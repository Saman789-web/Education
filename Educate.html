		<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in Pakistan is overseen by the Federal Ministry of Education and the provincial governments, while the federal government mostly assists in curriculum development, accreditation and the financing of research and development. Article 25-A of the Constitution of Pakistan obligates the state to provide free and compulsory quality education to children of the age group 5 to 16 years. "The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of five to sixteen years in such a manner as may be determined by law".[3] Considering the challenges confronting the youth in Pakistan, it's hardly astonishing that well-off and educated young individuals and professionals are opting to depart the country whenever they have the opportunity, exacerbating the brain drain phenomenon.</p>
	<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The education system in Pakistan[5] is generally divided into six levels: preschool (for the age from 3 to 5 years), primary (years one to five), middle (years six to eight), secondary (years nine and ten, leading to the Secondary School Certificate or SSC), intermediate (years eleven and twelve, leading to a Higher Secondary School Certificate or HSSC), and university programs leading to undergraduate and graduate degrees.[6] The Higher Education Commission established in 2002 is responsible for all universities and degree awarding institutes.[7] It was established in 2002 with Atta-ur-Rahman as its Founding Chairm</p>

In tribal areas female literacy is 9.5%,[11] while Azad Kashmir has a literacy rate of 74%.[12] Pakistan's population of children not in school (22.8 million children) is the second largest in the world after Nigeria.[13] According to the data, Pakistan faces a significant unemployment challenge, particularly among its educated youth, with over 31% of them being unemployed. Moreover, women account for 51% of the overall unemployed population, highlighting a gender disparity in employment opportunities.[14] Pakistan produces about 445,000 university graduates and 25,000 to 30,000 computer science graduates per year As of 2021Pakistan still has a low literacy rate relative to other countries.</p>

		<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Upon completion of year 9, students are expected to take a standardised test in each of the first parts of their academic subjects (SSC-I). They again take these tests of the second parts of the same courses at the end of year 10 (SSC-II). Upon successful completion of these examinations, they are awarded a Secondary School Certificate (or SSC). This is locally termed a 'matriculation certificate' or 'matric' for short. The curriculum usually includes a combination of eight courses including electives (such as Biology, Chemistry, Computer and Physics) as well as compulsory subjects (such as Mathematics, English, Urdu, Islamic studies and Pakistan Studies). The total marks for Matric are 1100 divided between 9th and 10th.[20] The marks are divided in each year follows: 75 marks for Maths, English and Urdu, 50 marks for Islamic Studies (or ethics for Non Muslim students) and Pakistan Studies, 65 marks for Sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Physics).</p><p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> An additional 90 marks are allotted for practicals (30 for each science). Students then enter an intermediate college and complete year 11 and 12. Upon completion of each of the two years, they again take standardised tests in their academic subjects (HSSC-I and HSSC-II). Upon successful completion of these examinations, students are awarded the Higher Secondary School Certificate (or HSSC). This level of education is also called the FSc/FA/ICS or 'intermediate'. There are many streams students can choose for their 11 and 12 years, such as pre-medical, pre-engineering, humanities (or social sciences), computer science and commerce. Each stream consists of three electives and as well as three compulsory subjects of English, Urdu, Islamiat (year 11 only) and Pakistan Studies (year 12 only).</p>
